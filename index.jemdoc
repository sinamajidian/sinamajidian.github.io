== About me
I'm currently working at [https://www.us1.dgene.com/ DGene] as a senior engineer. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Louisiana State University, under the guidance of Dr. [http://csc.lsu.edu/~msun/ Mingxuan Sun]. My research focuses on developing computationally efficient machine learning as well as deep learning models and algorithms, with applications in recommender systems, time-series analysis, computer vision, computer graphics, natural language processing, and fairness.
