About Me
======

I finished my PhD in 2020 at Iran University of Science and Technology where I was working on mathematical analysis of the haplotype assembly problem under supervision of [Dr. Kahaei](http://www.iust.ac.ir/content/45107/Dr.-Kahaei). I spent one year as a guest researcher in the Bioinformatics group of Wageningen University working on polyploid haplotype estimation using 10X Genomics linked-read data under supervision of [Prof. Dick de Ridder](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Dickprof.dr.ir.-D-Dick-de-Ridder.htm). I have joined Prof. Dessimoz's lab as a Postdoctoral Fellow to develop algorithms for orthology inference since May 2021.

 My research interest is in the broad disciplines related to data and signal processing particularly in genomics. Specifically:

 - Comparative genomics
 - Genetic variation
 - Haplotype assembly
 - Matrix completion
 - Data Science
 - Signal processing
